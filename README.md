# Reinforcement learning (RL)Flappy Bird

Let's build a simple reinforcement learning (RL) model using Q-learning and a minimal custom environment â€” no gym needed.

We'll simulate a very basic game like Flappy Bird:

The agent is running in a 1D world.

Obstacles appear randomly.

The agent can either "jump" or "do nothing".

If it doesn't jump over an obstacle, it loses.
